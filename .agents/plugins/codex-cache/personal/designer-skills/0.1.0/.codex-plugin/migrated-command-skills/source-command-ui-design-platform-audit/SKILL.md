2. **Navigation** — Review back navigation, tab structure, and gesture zones for each platform using `platform-conventions` skill.
3. **Controls** — Check that components match platform-native equivalents (toggles, pickers, dialogs) using `platform-conventions` skill.
4. **Typography** — Verify system font usage and dynamic type scale compliance for each platform using `platform-conventions` skill.
5. **Responsive** — Confirm layout adapts across screen sizes and orientations using `responsive-design` skill.
